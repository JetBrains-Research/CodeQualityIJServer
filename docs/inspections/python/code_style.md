## Code style inspections

### General definition

**Code style** issue means that your code violates one of the rules recorded in the style guide 
for the language youâ€™re using. It is highly recommended to fix such issues 
so that your code style matches that of other developers.

### Enabled issues

<details>
  <summary>PyRedundantParenthesesInspection</summary>

Reports about redundant parentheses in expressions.

Arguments (by default all are `false`):
- `ignoreEmptyBaseClasses` - ignore empty lists of base classes
- `ignoreTupleInReturn` - ignore tuples in return
- `ignorePercOperator` - ignore argument of % operator

Example:
```python
if (True):
    print(1)
```

Default description: `Remove redundant parentheses`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyAugmentAssignmentInspection</summary>

Reports assignments that can be replaced with augmented assignments.

Example:
```python
a = 23
b = 3
a = a + b
```

Default description: `Assignment can be replaced with an augmented assignment`
Adapted hint: `Assignment can be replaced with an augmented assignment, e.g 'a = a + b' is the same with 'a += b'`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyMethodParametersInspection</summary>

Reports methods that lack the first parameter that is usually named self.
The inspection also reports naming issues in class methods.

1. Example:
```python
class Movie:
    def show():
        pass
```

Default description: `Method must have a first parameter, usually called ''{0}''`,
`Usually first parameter of a method is named 'self'`,
`Usually first parameter of such methods is named ''{0}''`

2. Example:
```python
class Movie:
    def show(sself):
        pass
```

Default description: `Did not you mean 'self'?`

Note: this inspection uses the following list of words with typos: `{"eslf", "sself", "elf", "felf", "slef", "seelf", "slf", "sslf", "sefl", "sellf", "sef", "seef"}`

3. Example:
```python
class Foo(object): 

  def loo((f, g), *rest):
    pass # complain at tuple
```

Default description: `First parameter of a non-static method must not be a tuple`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyUnreachableCodeInspection</summary>

Reports code fragments that cannot be normally reached.

Example:
```python
if True:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Default description: `This code is unreachable`
</details>


<details>
  <summary>PyTrailingSemicolonInspection</summary>

Reports trailing semicolons in statements.def my_func(a): c = a ** 2; return c

Example:
```python
def my_func(a):
    c = a ** 2;
    return c
```

Default description: `Trailing semicolon in the statement`
Adapted message: `You don't need to use a semicolon here`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyStatementEffectInspection</summary>

Reports statements that have no effect.

Example:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, speed=0):
        self.speed = speed
        self.time
```

Default description: `Statement seems to have no effect`
Adapted description: `You can delete this statement since it has no effect`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyPep8NamingInspection</summary>

Reports violations of the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) naming conventions.

1. Example:
```python
class cls:
    pass
```

Default description: `Class names should use CamelCase convention`

2. Example:
```python
class A:
    def FuNc(self):
        pass
```

Default description: `Function name should be lowercase`

3. Example:
```python
class A:
    def foo(self, Arg):
        pass
```

Default description: `Argument name should be lowercase`

4. Example:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

def f():
    Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x1", "x2"], verbose=True)
    Test = "foo"
```

Default description: `Variable in function should be lowercase`

DISABLE
5. Example:
```python
from x import TEST as test
```

Default description: `Constant variable imported as non-constant`

DISABLE
6. Example:
```python
from x import y as TEST
```

Default descriptions: `Lowercase variable imported as non-lowercase`, `CamelCase variable imported as lowercase`,
`CamelCase variable imported as constant`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyPep8Inspection</summary>

Reports violations of the PEP 8 coding style guide by running the bundled [pycodestyle.py](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) tool.

Use a special config to run the tool.

**TODO: add the final config**
</details>

### Disabled issues

<details>
  <summary>PyInconsistentIndentationInspection</summary>

Reports inconsistent indentation in Python source files when, for example, you use a mixture of tabs and spaces in your code.

Default descriptions:

- `Inconsistent indentation: previous line used tabs, this line uses spaces`
- `Inconsistent indentation: previous line used spaces, this line uses tabs`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>PyClassicStyleClassInspection</summary>

Reports classic style classes usage. This inspection applies only to Python 2.

Default descriptions: `Old-style class`, `Old-style class, because all classes from whom it inherits are old-style`

<details>
  <summary>PyNonAsciiCharInspection</summary>

Reports cases in Python 2 when a file contains non-ASCII
characters and does not have an encoding declaration at the top.
