## Code complexity inspections

#### General definition

Code complexity issue means that your solution is poorly designed or overly complicated. 
Reducing code complexity makes it easier to understand, edit, 
and debug any given part of your program including functions, classes, modules, and so on. 
High code complexity means that some part of your program contains too many conditions, 
loops, logical operators; in other words, it does too many things. 
To fix this issue, you need to decompose your code into several smaller parts.
